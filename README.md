# Food Ordering ChatBot using Dialogflow

This project is an AI-powered Food Ordering Chatbot designed to simulate a real-world food ordering and tracking experience.
The chatbot allows users to place food orders conversationally, modify orders dynamically, complete orders, and track order status — all through natural language interaction.

The system is built using Dialogflow ES for intent handling, FastAPI for backend webhook processing, and MySQL for persistent order storage.

This project demonstrates strong concepts in backend development, stateful conversations, API integration, and database-driven business logic.

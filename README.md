# Food Ordering ChatBot using Dialogflow

***This project is an AI-powered Food Ordering Chatbot designed to simulate a real-world food ordering and tracking experience.
The chatbot allows users to place food orders conversationally, modify orders dynamically, complete orders, and track order status — all through natural language interaction.***

***The system is built using Dialogflow ES for intent handling, FastAPI for backend webhook processing, and MySQL for persistent order storage.***

***This project demonstrates strong concepts in backend development, stateful conversations, API integration, and database-driven business logic.***
